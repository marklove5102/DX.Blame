# Roadmap: DX.Blame

## Overview

DX.Blame delivers inline Git blame annotations in the Delphi IDE, progressing from a stable OTA plugin foundation through the async blame data pipeline, into visual rendering with full UX controls, and finally enhanced tooltip/commit detail views. Each phase builds on the previous and delivers an independently verifiable capability.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [x] **Phase 1: Package Foundation** - Installable BPL with stable OTA lifecycle and clean unload (completed 2026-03-19)
- [x] **Phase 2: Blame Data Pipeline** - Async git blame execution, parsing, and thread-safe caching (completed 2026-03-19)
- [x] **Phase 3: Inline Rendering and UX** - Visible blame annotations with toggle, navigation, and configuration (completed 2026-03-23)
- [x] **Phase 4: Tooltip and Commit Detail** - Click-triggered popup with full commit info and modal diff detail view (completed 2026-03-23)
- [x] **Phase 5: Tech Debt Cleanup** - Fix latent bugs, implement theme-aware annotation color, break circular dependency, remove dead code (completed 2026-03-23)

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Package Foundation
**Goal**: The plugin installs as a design-time BPL in Delphi 11.3+, 12, and 13, registers with the IDE, and unloads cleanly without crashes
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: UX-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can install the BPL via Component > Install Packages in Delphi 11.3+, 12, and 13
  2. Plugin appears in the IDE splash screen and Help > About dialog
  3. User can uninstall and reinstall the BPL without IDE crashes or access violations
  4. OTA notifier registration and removal lifecycle is centralized and leak-free
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Project scaffold, build infrastructure, and OTA registration implementation
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — DUnitX tests and IDE integration verification

### Phase 2: Blame Data Pipeline
**Goal**: The plugin detects git repos, executes git blame asynchronously, parses porcelain output, and stores results in a thread-safe per-file cache
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: BLAME-02, BLAME-03, BLAME-04, BLAME-05, BLAME-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Plugin detects whether the current project resides in a git repository (by walking parent directories for .git)
  2. Opening a file triggers an async git blame that completes without blocking the IDE
  3. Blame results (author, date, commit hash, message) are correctly parsed from git blame --porcelain output and stored per line
  4. Cached blame data is invalidated on file save and blame re-executes automatically
  5. Multiple files can be opened concurrently without race conditions or data corruption
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Data types, git discovery, and git process wrapper (foundation units)
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Porcelain parser, thread-safe cache, and unit tests
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — Blame engine orchestrator, IDE notifiers, and Registration.pas wiring

### Phase 3: Inline Rendering and UX
**Goal**: Users see blame annotations inline at the end of the current code line and can toggle, configure, and navigate blame
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: BLAME-01, CONF-01, CONF-02, UX-01, UX-02, UX-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User sees author and relative time (e.g. "John Doe, 3 months ago") rendered after the last character of the current line
  2. User can toggle blame display on/off via IDE menu entry and via a configurable hotkey
  3. User can configure display format (author on/off, date format relative/absolute, max length) and blame text color, or color adapts to the current IDE theme automatically
  4. User can navigate to the annotated revision (file opened at the commit shown in the annotation) for the current line
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Settings persistence (INI) and annotation formatter with unit tests
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Editor renderer (INTACodeEditorEvents), menu toggle, and keyboard shortcut
- [x] 03-03-PLAN.md — Settings configuration dialog and revision navigation

### Phase 4: Tooltip and Commit Detail
**Goal**: Users get full commit context by clicking a blame annotation and can drill into the complete diff without leaving the IDE
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: TTIP-01, TTIP-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Clicking on the blame annotation shows a popup with commit hash, author, full date, and complete commit message
  2. User can open a commit detail view from the popup that displays the full diff (git show output) in a modal dialog
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Commit detail cache, popup panel, click detection, and renderer wiring
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — Modal diff dialog with RTF coloring, scope toggle, size persistence, and tests

### Phase 5: Tech Debt Cleanup
**Goal**: Fix latent bugs, implement IDE theme-aware annotation color, break circular unit dependency, and clean up dead code and stale documentation
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Requirements**: CONF-02 (improve auto-color path)
**Gap Closure**: Closes tech debt from v1.0 milestone audit
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. DeriveAnnotationColor returns a theme-blended color using INTACodeEditorServices instead of hardcoded clGray
  2. Registration.pas finalization guards use >= 0 instead of > 0 for wizard and about-box cleanup
  3. Circular dependency between DX.Blame.KeyBinding and DX.Blame.Registration is broken
  4. Orphaned OnShowDiffClick property removed from TDXBlamePopup
  5. GetAnnotationClickableLength documentation matches actual behavior (author name span)
  6. TTIP-02 traceability table entry updated from Pending to Complete
**Plans**: 1 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 05-01-PLAN.md — Theme-aware color, circular dependency fix, and dead code cleanup
